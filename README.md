# personal_site
**SUMMARY**
This is my personal website as well as the first project I've built in react! It's always going to be under the "current" section of the Projects page as it will be continually updated.

**WHY**
After being approached by serveral recruiters on Linkedin and not having an anywhere to show my work, I figured it would be a good idea to start working on a simple porfolio website that can hold my projects (and serve as a project itself üòÅ). Though as of 3/13/22 20:17 I'm not 100% decided on a career, it doesn't hurt to have somewhere to show what I've been up to.

**HOW**
I've been messing around with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a few months now but I've never used React before. For this project I wanted to make practicing React the main focus so I cut out manually setting up webpack and used the create-react-app template.
