# personal_site

# **SUMMARY**

This is my personal website as well as the first project I've built in react! It's always going to be under the "current" section of the Projects page as it will be continually updated.

# **WHY**

After being approached by serveral recruiters on Linkedin and not having an anywhere to show my work, I figured it would be a good idea to start working on a simple porfolio website that can hold my projects (and serve as a project itself üòÅ). Though as of 3/13/22 20:17 I'm not 100% decided on a career, it doesn't hurt to have somewhere to show what I've been up to.

# **HOW**

I've been messing around with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript semi-consistently for a few months now but I've never used React before. For this project I wanted to make practicing React the main focus so I cut out manually setting up webpack and used the create-react-app template.

I started with the creation of the components folder to help me keep all of my components organized. After this, I created components for the webpage from top to bottom (Header, Body, Footer folders and components). At this point my home page was complete, but I needed a way to access the other pages I wanted on my website.

Initially, I was hesitant to use the React Router as I'm well aware how susceptible my projects are to scope creep but I bit the bullet and kept it simple. It was also at this point where I created the routes folder and added the respective routes and components. While the Blogs page remains under construction, the Projects page implements props to dynamically create elements.

# **CLOSING**

I'm happy with the website so far considering I was coming from no React knowledge. Though, after building the site this far, I can tell there's a lot more to learn.
